Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

The bad actor could tamper the input and would result in information disclosure. Therefor, every input that is taken
needs to be sanitized to prevent any tampering of the data or access to the database. 
We have sanitized the input and verified that its only a string is inputed. The secure version removes all the non-
alphanumeric character that is not part of the username has been requested to be removed. 
It violates confidentiality and integrity. 
We should hash the password and store it so that it can not be abstracted while in transit either.
