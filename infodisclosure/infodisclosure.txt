Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

The vulnerability would occor when untrusted input is used directly in a database query
similar to NoSQL injection. This happens when proper validation or sanitization of input 
is not conducted properly. The sure version has tried to mitigate the issue by sanitizing
the provided input into string and different values so that it could not interact with the
database and manupulate the data. 
This type of vulnerability tampers with the integrity aspect of the CIA as it aims to 
tamper with the data stored in the database. 
For additional security, we could sanitize the input by parameterizing queries to automatically
handle input sanitization using database library. Furthermore, using rate limiting which would 
prevent brute force attacsk or denial-of-service attacks on the authentication endpoints.
