Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The insecure.js does not prevent the bad actors from retrieving the session data/ hijacking. Therefore, bad actors
can easily log in/ impersonate the stolen creditial from the stolen session information.
On the other hand, the secure version, the cookie option has additional setting for the session cookie. This preventing 
bad actors from easily gaining the session information. Furthermore, post request authenticate the user and if aunthcated
sends back a success message, otherwise, does not allow permission.
