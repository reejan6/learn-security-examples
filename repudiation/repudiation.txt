- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?


The secure version is creating a log file and updating the data to the log file so that it can track. Also,
there is a middleware function that would assist if something goes wrong with the request.

For extra security mechanism, there has to be a function for an audit trail so that it can be tracked when needed.
