- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The secure version has the try and catch block that prevents bad input from bad actors.  
In context of denial of service, we can make secure.js more secure by adding rate limiting from a user. The middleware 
could limit the rate of accessing the database so that the database does not get overwhelmed.
Since, dos affects the process, data flow and data storage in an application. Thus, we need to 
make sure we do authorization check to prevent any modification of disk or memory to execute
non-authorized commands.
