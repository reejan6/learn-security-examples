Tampering could happen in the insecure.js as the input has not been cleaned as the user could input a script and can get access;
however, secure.js prevents that by converting the input into a string, also removing the possiblity of submitting script as it 
disables certain input scripts. 

Tampering violate the integrity property of the CIA, as it changes the input from the user. Since, the tampering changes 
the input, it does not provide the correct information to the server. This prevent bad actors but still violate the 
integrity of the question/ purpose. Nevertheless, the protection of the data being used by hackers are more important to
be prevented than anything else.
